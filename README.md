This project involved modifying a Spring application with a Java back end and an Angular front end to meet new requirements for a hotel reservation system. The goal was to add features such as multithreaded language translation, displaying messages in different time zones, and showing prices in multiple currencies. I worked on internationalization by creating resource bundles for English and French, and displayed a welcome message in both languages using separate threads. Additionally, I modified the front-end to display reservation prices in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, and euros, and wrote a Java method to convert and display times for an online live presentation across Eastern, Mountain, and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) zones.

I also containerized the application by building a Docker image of the multithreaded Spring application, learning how to use Docker to create and deploy a containerized environment for the app. Throughout the project, I used GitLab for version control, committing and pushing changes as I completed each task. This project gave me valuable experience in localization, multithreading, time zone management, and Docker, which are important skills for software development and will be useful in future job opportunities.
